This is a repository for a Jupyter notebook for the Week 3 assignment in University of Colorado Boulder CSCA 5642: Introduction to Deep Learning.

The assignment is to create a submission for a [Kaggle competition on histopathologic cancer detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection/overview). The competition provides a slightly modified version of the PatchCamelyon (PCam) benchmark dataset and asks competitors to predict whether small pathology images contain at least one pixel of cancer tissue.
